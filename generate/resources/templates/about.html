					<p>
						The ROBLOX API Reference is a project that aims to
						document ROBLOX's Lua API as thoroughly as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
						Almost all of the pages on this site are generated
						from ROBLOX's "API dumps". These are files generated
						by the ROBLOX client, containing information about the
						<a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> API. This
						project parses the API dump for each version of
						ROBLOX, and automatically displays human- readable
						information about the API's classes, class members,
						enums, types, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project is open source. The repository that
						generates this site is available <a href="https://github.com/Anaminus/roblox-api-ref">
						here, on GitHub</a>. You are free to fork and modify it
						to your heart's content.
					</p>
					<p>
						What this project can't do automatically is provide
						documentation for each API item. While I am slowly adding
						descriptions here and there, you can also help out. Check
						out the <a href="/api/contribute.html">Contribute</a> page
						for more information.
					</p>
					<h2>ROBLOX</h2>
					<p>
						<a href="http://www.roblox.com/">ROBLOX</a> is an
						online virtual playground and workshop â€” where kids of
						all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and
						learn. It's unique in that practically everything in
						this infinite playground is designed and constructed
						by individual members of the ROBLOX community.
